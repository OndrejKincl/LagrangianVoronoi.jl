# LagrangianVoronoi.jl - Documentation

A method for Euler/Navier-Stokes fluids combining Lagrangian paradigm with Voronoi tesselation. 
The method is described in our [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fld.5339) but recently, we extended the code for compressible flows. You will need [paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) to plot the results.
